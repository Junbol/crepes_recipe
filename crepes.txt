Crepes Ingredients:
Flour: These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.
Eggs: Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.
Milk: Milk adds moisture and keeps the crêpes tender.
Water: Water helps thin the batter.
Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.
Butter: Butter lends richness and moisture to the crêpes.

Steps:
1. Whisk the flour and eggs.
2. Gradually add the milk and water.
3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle.
4. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom.
5. Flip and continue cooking until done on both sides.

Buen provecho!
